# Roblox Profile Viewer 🎮

This is a simple, functional profile viewer for Roblox. While the current UI is minimal, it is designed to be efficient and will be improved in future updates to enhance both usability and appearance.

## Purpose 🎯

The project retrieves and displays information about a Roblox account using your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie. It is designed to be transparent, open-source, and easy to audit, ensuring that users can verify it is not a logger or malicious in any way.

## Features ✨

The profile viewer provides the following information:
- **ID**: The unique identifier of the account.
- **Username**: The account's username.
- **Display Name**: The account's display name.
- **Robux Balance**: The current amount of Robux in the account.
- **Premium Status**: Indicates whether the account has an active premium subscription.
- **Friends**: The total number of friends the account has.
- **Followers**: The total number of followers the account has.

## Security 🔒

This project is open-source, allowing users to inspect the code and verify that it contains no harmful components. The `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie is used exclusively to fetch data from Roblox APIs and is never logged or stored.

## Future Plans 🚀

- Improve the user interface for a more streamlined experience.
- Add additional features and customization options.
