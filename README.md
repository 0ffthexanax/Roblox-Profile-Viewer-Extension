# Roblox Profile Viewer 🎮

This is a simple, functional profile viewer for Roblox. While the current UI is minimal, it is designed to be efficient and will be improved in future updates to enhance both usability and appearance.

## Purpose 🎯

The project retrieves and displays information about a Roblox account using your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie. It is designed to be transparent, open-source, and easy to audit, ensuring that users can verify it is not a logger or malicious in any way.

## Security 🔒

This project is open-source, allowing users to inspect the code and verify that it contains no harmful components. The `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie is used exclusively to fetch data from Roblox APIs and is never logged or stored.
