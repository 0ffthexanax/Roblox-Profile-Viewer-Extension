# Roblox Profile Viewer

This is a basic profile viewer for Roblox. While the current UI is minimal and functional, it will be improved in the future to enhance usability and appearance.

## Purpose

The project displays information about a Roblox account using your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie. It is designed to be transparent, open-source, and easy to review, ensuring users can verify it's not a logger or malicious in any way.

## Features

The profile viewer displays the following details:
- **ID**: The unique identifier of the account.
- **Username**: The account's username.
- **Display Name**: The account's display name.
- **Robux Amount**: The current Robux balance.
- **Premium Status**: Whether the account has an active premium subscription.
- **Friends**: The total number of friends.
- **Followers**: The total number of followers.

## Security

This project is open-source to allow users to inspect the code and ensure there are no harmful components. The `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie is used solely to fetch information from Roblox APIs and is never logged or stored.

## Future Plans

- Improving the UI for a more user-friendly experience.
- Adding additional features and customizations.
